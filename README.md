- who am I?

- I always keep failing to be a good friend

- I keep crying and being sensitive

- I cant keep up with my friends

- I want to kill myself but I cant

- My friends are keep ignoring me and unfriending me

- I wanna be just left alone in a room and locked up

- My family keeps getting angry at me tough i dont do anything bad

- I just want to keep up with LIFE.

- My mom keeps tryna hit me

- . . .

- I want someone to talk these but i dont have friends like THAT to explain it,

- My bsf is already in trouble I dont want to remember his ex n stuff

- I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED
