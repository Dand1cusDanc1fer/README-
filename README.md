<< everyday im wishing for something i know it will never come .

<< i feel like im trapped in a box made of my moms abusements for me.

<< im smiling everyday to not make my friends unhappy or worried but i cant take it anymore . 

<< ,, Behind every sweet smile there is a bitter sadness that no one can ever see and feel .

<< im tired of not getting noticed and my classmates making fun of me .

<< so i just hope one day life will be better . . . 

<< im tired of anything in my life .

<< i want to just fucking suicide .






<< I WANT TO GET RID OF MY LIFE .
